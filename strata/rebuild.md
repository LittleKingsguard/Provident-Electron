# Provident-Electron — the rebuild protocol

Procedure for a rebuilt artifact (D-1). Ceiling: 40 lines.

## 1. Eligibility

**Repeat failure** means the same artifact id fails the same test class on **3 consecutive repair
passes**. The count lives in `strata-state` as the per-artifact `streaks` entry and is never counted by
 eye, because an undefined "repeat" is the prose trigger that rots first (D-1). Below threshold the
recommendation is rejected; the streak alone is also not enough, and the examiner still judges
whether the code is worth salvaging. An adjudication request from a lower layer counts as one failure
(D-1 §5): asking is not a pause and is not free.

The streak is cleared **per artifact**: that artifact's own `pass` deletes its entry, a `pass` on a
sibling leaves it standing, and `lastFailure` is cleared only by `rebuild` — so a per-artifact
`streaks` map and a standing `lastFailure` can both be true at once (`platform.md` §4, D-1).

## 2. What the examiner may emit

`examiner.md` §4 — one statement of the rule, not two, and the envelope check enforces it (D-1).

## 3. Who decides

One layer above the examiner (D-1). Recommending a rebuild asserts that the examiner's own layer
designed wrongly — three passes on one design indicts the design, not the code — and a layer cannot
adjudicate its own design (D-1 §2).

## 4. Retrospective, before teardown

The owning layer's designer writes ≤ 20 lines answering exactly three questions: what did we
believe that was false; which test should have caught it and why it did not; what changes next cycle
(D-1). It **replaces** the recommendation it supersedes in `strata/records/` — there is no per-unit archive (D-52) — is never appended to a live design document, and never
re-opens an earlier cycle's reasoning (D-1, D-2).

## 5. Then

Teardown, then a fresh cycle from the layer that owns the artifact. The unit keeps its id, the
retrospective is the only carry-over, and the new cycle starts from the artifact spec rather than
from the abandoned code (D-1). A second rebuild of the same artifact escalates again instead of
repeating: two rebuilds are evidence about the upstream design, not about the implementer (D-1).
