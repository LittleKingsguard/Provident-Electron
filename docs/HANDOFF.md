# Provident-Electron → Preempt-Providence Issue Handoff

This is the issue-handoff document (AGENTS.md item 7): the finished catalogue
of requirement gaps / defects discovered while consuming `provident-ssr` as an
Electron/MCP host. Each row is an issue candidate for the ORIGINAL project
(`Preempt-Providence`, adjacent folder). This repo does NOT fix the package —
the fix shapes below are upstream-owned.

Full catalogue: `docs/defects.md` (this file is the handoff assembly; defects.md
is the living tracker). Where relevant, "consumer workaround" = what
Provident-Electron does today so the gap is not blocking.

---

## Round 1 — REQ-GAP-1..7 (filed 2026-08-21): RESOLVED by provident-ssr 0.1.1

The upstream ran a three-agent change-analysis (`docs/specs/handoffs-review.md`)
and landed the accepted shapes in **provident-ssr 0.1.1**. Disposition per
issue:

| Issue | 0.1.1 landing | This repo's adoption |
| --- | --- | --- |
| REQ-GAP-1 (inline handlers default modern) | **PASS-AS-DOCUMENTED** — FORMAT MARKER + ssr-synthetic-event.md §2.3 sentence | Demo bodies stay modern `(ctx, value)` |
| REQ-GAP-2 (css.id not a runtime lookup key) | **PASS-WITH-RESHAPE** — host-side index documented (css.id is a set; exclude destroyed/unplaced/prototype); NO engine surface | Runtime target resolver maps css.id → nodeId |
| REQ-GAP-3 (id collision + auto-mint) | **PASS-WITH-RESHAPE** — DEFECT #28 (mint-excluded from reverse), precedence doc (`css.id > props.id > mint`), opt-in `renderOptions.nodeIdAttribute` → `data-node-id` | **ADOPTED** — `emitElements(…, { nodeIdAttribute: true })`; every element carries `data-node-id` |
| REQ-GAP-4 (dispatch returns no dirtied / no idempotency) | **PASS** — `Supervisor.dispatchAndReport` ({results, dirtied}, engine-derived) + opt-in bounded `requestId` dedup + public `flush()` | **ADOPTED** — Runtime uses `dispatchAndReport`; host dedup removed |
| REQ-GAP-5 (re-emit loop boilerplate) | **PASS** — `renderProducingProcess` exported + `flush()` | Partial — see REQ-GAP-8 |
| REQ-GAP-6 (DomAdapter needs a DOM) | **CLOSED-ALREADY-ADDRESSED** | Renderer-hosts the graph; IPC bridge |
| REQ-GAP-7 (CSP silently skips string bodies) | **PASS-WITH-RESHAPE** — distinct `handler-body-eval-blocked` warn code + docs | CSP `'unsafe-eval'` stays (environment constraint); the failure is now detectable |

## Round 2 — REQ-GAP-8 (filed 2026-08-21): RESOLVED by provident-ssr 0.1.2

- **Gap**: the exported canonical re-emit loop `renderProducingProcess` could
  not thread the opt-in `nodeIdAttribute` option (the handoffs-review Opening
  A/B planned the loop absorbing the A2 option in the same pass; the 0.1.1
  loop omitted it).
- **0.1.2 landing**: `renderProducingProcess(actionable, nodeById, adapter,
  prevMap, renderOptions?)` — the optional `renderOptions` threads to
  `emitElements`; `{ nodeIdAttribute: true }` stamps `data-node-id`, default
  undefined = byte-identical render. Ownership rules unchanged.
- **This repo's adoption**: the Runtime's re-emit now calls
  `renderProducingProcess(…, { nodeIdAttribute: true })` per adapter (DOM +
  SSR, each with its own caller-owned prevMap). The explicit emit-with-options
  loop is removed. Verified live in Electron (data-node-id DOM=SSR on all 12
  elements; engine dirtied; engine dedup echo; event.value echo).

## Round 3 — no new gaps

0.1.2 closes the catalogue. No new requirement gaps discovered during the
0.1.2 adoption pass. The sole remaining work is consumer-side debugging
niceties (next-steps items: surface `TranslatedTree.warnings` through MCP,
renderer debug panel).

## Round 4 — REQ-GAP-9..12 (filed 2026-08-21, from the E2E-battery plan) — PUBLISHED in provident-ssr 0.1.3

The upstream ran its own three-agent gate on these four
(`../Preempt-Providence/docs/specs/handoffs-review-2.md`, user rulings
2026-08-21/22) — all **APPROVED-WITH-RESHAPE** and **PUBLISHED in
provident-ssr@0.1.3** (verified in the installed dist: `createLinkHub`,
`LinkConfigNameHub` type, the self-evicting sweep `evictDestroyedNode`/
`destroyedRefs`, the destroy-cascade `markCascadeExplicit`). The battery's
workarounds (vendored hub, accepted registry growth, per-child teardown) are
now droppable in favor of the published surfaces.

| Issue | Gap (as filed) | Upstream disposition (published 0.1.3) | This repo's response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **REQ-GAP-9** | No public `LinkConfigNameHub` factory; `loadState`→graph construction is test-only | `createLinkHub()` + type export + the `node.ts:463` seed-hub threading + the corrected 4-step recipe (`loadState` → `new Node(d,hub)` template-first → `reconcileParentTargets` → `registerNode` per node, ONE hub everywhere). Caveat (user ruling): component-bearing docs → `translateLegacy(doc, {hub})`; `serializeSlice`→`loadState` is snapshot/restore-only. | Battery A1 uses the exported `createLinkHub()` (no vendored hub). Component-bearing first-class loads use `translateLegacy(doc,{hub})` regardless. |
| **REQ-GAP-10** | No sanctioned handler-body-by-name injection | Doc-only seam letter: `addLayer` sanctioned for PRE-MOUNT prototype setup (fork-stress pattern); in-tree live injection via journaled `state-slice handlers`/`layer-apply`; prefix rules; hooks delimiter; D16 precedence + clone inheritance. `registerHandlerBody` REJECTED. | Battery's pre-mount prototype injection IS the sanctioned seam; bodies imported with provenance comment + guard test. |
| **REQ-GAP-11** | No `Supervisor` reset; destroyed nodes accumulate | Self-evicting sweep (`finalizeDestroyed` evicts from registered/byId/content/minted + supervisor nodes; `destroyedRefs` tombstone keeps `getNode`). `reset()`/`prune()`/`unregisterNode` REJECTED. | Battery asserts `inTree`/mount only (never `registered` equality), fresh requestIds per scenario; the sweep means the registry no longer grows across scenarios. |
| **REQ-GAP-12** | No single clear-children op | Destroy-cascade trigger flag (explicit children only, skips placements + `'component'`-token prototypes, runtimeMinted → retention). `clear-children` op REJECTED. | Battery teardown = per-child destroy loop (the pinned shape for fork-stress even post-cascade: clones are runtimeMinted, prototypes skipped); cascade helps plain family trees. |

## Handoff mechanics

- The upstream project receives these as issues (symptom / reproduction / root
  cause / proposed fix shape above). File them against
  `github.com/LittleKingsguard/Preempt-Providence` (or the project's chosen
  tracker). Round 1 issues are closed by 0.1.1; REQ-GAP-8 is the open follow-up.
- None of these require a behavior change in THIS repo to unblock; the consumer
  workarounds are in place.
- Environment-only findings (Node 18 vs Electron 43 tooling, ESM-main CJS
  requirement, MCP SDK stateless-HTTP wiring) are NOT package defects — they are
  recorded in `docs/decisions.md` / `docs/pending.md` for this repo's own
  maintenance.

## Round 5 — DEFECT-SSR-REMOVE (filed 2026-08-23, from the adapter-parity battery) — RESOLVED in provident-ssr 0.1.4

- **Issue**: `SSRFragmentAdapter` retains removed/destroyed elements in the
  serialized fragment, diverging from `DomAdapter`.
- **Symptom / repro**: load an envelope with `keeper`/`doomed`/`nuke` (nuke =
  `{kind:'destroy'}` on `doomed`), dispatch nuke →
  `provident.get_rendered_html`. The DOM collapses to root-only; the SSR
  fragment STILL contains `doomed` AND the full prior subtree
  (`keeper`/`doomed`/`nuke`). Repro: `tests/adapter-parity-battery.test.mjs`
  S5 (spec `docs/specs/adapter-parity-battery.md`, greens
  `docs/specs/adapter-parity-greens.md`).
- **Root cause**: `SSRFragmentAdapter.removeEl` (dist/core/adapters.js:397-400)
  only did `fragments.delete(wireKey(...))` — it never detached the fragment
  from its parent's `children` array nor rematerialized the owner, so the
  removed element survived serialization. `DomAdapter.removeEl`
  (adapters.js:213-229) detaches + removes.
- **0.1.4 landing**: `SSRFragmentAdapter.removeEl` now splices the child out of
  its parent state's `children`, nulls its parent, purges it from `created`,
  and calls `rematerialize(parent)` — mirroring the DomAdapter detach
  (dist/core/adapters.js:397-424).
- **This repo's verification**: the adapter-parity battery S5 now reports "SSR
  drops the destroyed element (parity recovered)" — **73 checks, 0 failures**;
  the full trio green (433 tests, typecheck clean, build clean).

## Round 6 — DEFECT-JOURNAL-UNDO + DEFECT-JOURNAL-REPLAY-APPEND (filed 2026-08-24) — RESOLVED in provident-ssr 0.1.5

Two journal-reversibility defects surfaced by the stress battery
(`docs/specs/journal-reversibility-battery.md`, repro `tests/journal-reversibility.test.ts`):

- **DEFECT-JOURNAL-UNDO** — `Supervisor.undo()` reverted only `attach` /
  `destroy` / `rows-mint`; a `state-slice` undo was a silent no-op.
  **RESOLVED in 0.1.5**: `undo()` now inverts `state-slice` EXACTLY (the
  journaled `sliceLayers` → removeLayer per id + hooks `hookUndo` anchor
  restore + `markPass2`/consumer walk). The remaining kinds
  (`detach`/`move`/`clone-instance`/`layer-apply`/`placement-attach`/
  `rows-clear`) are **DOCUMENTED NO-OPs** in the G14 per-kind table (ops.md §6)
  with parked fact-sets — no longer silent gaps.
- **DEFECT-JOURNAL-REPLAY-APPEND** — a `state-slice append` replayed against an
  already-appended array grew it. **RESOLVED in 0.1.5**: replay() gates a
  state-slice whose recorded `sliceLayers` all exist (the OO-2 idempotency
  pattern); `redo()` is no-journal; clone-instance replay gates on `minted`
  liveness.

- **This repo's verification**: `tests/journal-reversibility.test.ts` (9 tests)
  now asserts the resolved contract — state-slice undo reverts (O1), append /
  append-first / replaceAll replay idempotent (O2/O2b/O3), detach + clone-instance
  undo as the documented no-op pins (O5/O7), destroy no-op (R11), atomicity (R5).
  **9/9 green; trio green (442 tests).**

The destroy-undo NO-OP is the documented contract pin (pending.md REQ-GAP-12 +
supervisor.js "destroy is terminal"), NOT a defect. Host-side: none — all
findings are engine-level.

## Round 7 — ISO-ADV-D (X13): `translateNodeData` `data.children` recursion drops `graphScope` (CRITICAL, filed 2026-08-25 → **RESOLVED in 0.2.0-rc.4**)

The 0.2.0-rc.3 isolation hardening (ISOLATION-A/B/C) introduced a NEW engine
defect that the host's SecurePanels adoption surfaced:

- **Symptom**: an isolated graph's CHILD nodes (e.g. the security-pane
  controls) are constructed with `graphScope = null` → they register in
  `DEFAULT_SCOPE` (the app/MCP graph's scope). This is an isolation LEAK (the
  pane nodes are resolvable/addressable from the app graph) AND it breaks the
  rc.3 cross-graph-target guard (a `state-slice` on a mis-scoped child is
  rejected `cross-graph-target`, so the pane cannot mutate its own controls).
- **Root cause**: `translate.ts:1046` — the `data.children` recursion in
  `translateNodeData` omits the trailing `graphScope` arg (the def-children
  site :835 and the template/content-children site :1117 both pass it).
- **Fix shape (upstream-owned)**: thread `graphScope` into the `data.children`
  recursion (one-line fix, matching :835/:1117).
- **This repo's verification**: `tests/secure-panels.test.ts` group-toggle +
  `tests/isolation-adversarial-e2e.test.ts` fail on rc.3 with
  `cross-graph-target`; the raw engine probe confirms `t.nodes[1].graphScope ===
  null` for an isolated graph's child. Filed upstream `docs/defects.md`
  ISO-ADV-D (X13) + `archive/test-data/2026-08-25/2026-08-25-isolation-adversarial-probe.md`.
- **RESOLVED (0.2.0-rc.4, commit `d1691cd`)**: the upstream threaded
  `graphScope` into the `data.children` recursion (translate.ts:1046). The host
  re-verified on rc.4 — SecurePanels + isolation-e2e pass again; `tests/isolation-adv-d.test.ts`
  asserts the child carries its scope. Trio green: 453 / 2 skipped, build clean,
  battery 184/184.

## Round 8 — UNDO-REDO-REPORT (J1): `undo()`/`redo()`/`replay()` return `void` + private stacks (filed 2026-08-26 → **RESOLVED in provident-ssr 0.2.1**)

The journal-endpoint proposal's J1 reshape (the blocking derivability gap) —
filed as a handoff item per AGENTS.md item 7:

- **Issue**: `Supervisor.undo()`/`redo()`/`replay()` return `void` and the
  `undoStack`/`redoStack` are private. An MCP/Electron host cannot faithfully
  report status / dirtied / stack-top-kind after a journal op — it cannot
  distinguish "work done + which nodes touched" from "silent no-op", nor know
  the next undoable/redoable op or the condensed-base boundary.
- **Symptom / repro**: the journal-reversibility battery drives the engine
  methods directly (`tests/journal-reversibility.test.ts`); an MCP agent has no
  tool that calls them, and a host wrapper cannot report the outcome.
- **Root cause**: `undo()`/`redo()`/`replay()` return `void`; the stacks are
  private (`supervisor.ts:131-132`).
- **Fix shape (upstream-owned)**: return an `UndoRedoReport`
  (`{ status: 'applied'|'no-op'|'base-boundary', scheduledDirtied, stackTopKind?,
  redoTopKind?, baseBoundary }`) + read-only stack accessors (`undoDepth`/
  `redoDepth`/`undoTopKind`/`redoTopKind`/`undoBaseBoundary`).
- **RESOLVED (0.2.1, commit `be11b2e`)**: the upstream landed exactly this as
  `docs/specs/undo-redo-report.md` (DECIDED). `scheduledDirtied` is the
  markPass2-SCHEDULED (pending-flush) set; a host awaiting settled states must
  `await flush()` + `takePass2States()`. The adversarial pass also fixed 13
  defects (ISO-1 cross-graph id leak in the undo consumer walk, UR-6 redo-of-
  failed-re-apply, UR-7 replay clears redoStack, MAL-1..6 malformed-op
  containment).
- **This repo's verification**: bumped to `provident-ssr@^0.2.1` (2026-08-26);
  typecheck clean. The journal-endpoint proposal's J1 reshape is unblocked — the
  host can now report `status`/`scheduledDirtied`/`stackTopKind`/`baseBoundary`
  faithfully.

## Round 9 — UNDO-REDO-DESTROY-STATUS: `undo()` of a `destroy` reports `applied` (filed 2026-08-26, from the journal-endpoint adversarial pass)

- **Issue**: `Supervisor.undo()` of a `destroy` entry (a G14 PINNED NO-OP)
  reports `status:'applied'` with an empty `scheduledDirtied` and an unchanged
  graph — a silent false-success. An MCP host surfaces `status:'applied'`
  verbatim, so an agent cannot tell a real undo from a no-op (the
  journal-endpoint-review.md J4 "no-op must never be silent" trap).
- **Symptom / repro**: `apply({kind:'destroy', node})` then `undo()` → the
  report is `{status:'applied', scheduledDirtied:[]}` and the render is
  unchanged. Repro: `tests/journal-endpoint.test.ts` J-adversarial destroy-undo.
- **Root cause**: `supervisor.js:1477-1479` — the destroy branch does nothing
  (no inverse, no dirtied ids) then falls through to
  `return this.report('applied', dirtied)` (:1577). The G14 pinned-no-op
  contract says destroy-undo is a no-op, but the report says `applied`.
- **Fix shape (upstream-owned)**: `undo()` should return `status:'no-op'` for a
  `destroy` entry (matching the G14 pinned-no-op contract), or expose a
  `destroyed` hint so a host can distinguish a no-op from a real inverse.
- **This repo's response**: the host surfaces the engine report verbatim (no
  host-side downgrade — the engine's `applied` is authoritative). The
  adversarial test pins the current behavior (no crash, report returned) and
  documents the package finding. Recorded in `docs/defects.md`
  UNDO-REDO-DESTROY-STATUS. **Adversarial gaps 4-10 closed 2026-08-26** — 7
  additional adversarial tests added to `tests/journal-endpoint.test.ts` (17
  total): replay-clears-redo (GAP 4), double-undo non-idempotent (GAP 5),
  dispatch-not-undoable (GAP 6), id-index-coherence (GAP 7), fail-closed gate
  (GAP 8), teardown-no-op (GAP 9), load-no-op (GAP 10). Gaps 1,2,3,11,12
  deferred (pending.md).

## Verified state (the workarounds ARE proven)

- Unit: `tests/runtime.test.ts` (9) + `tests/engine-surfaces.test.ts` (5) —
  green (14 total).
- MCP e2e (both transports, standalone server): `tests/mcp-stdio-e2e.test.mjs`
  — green (all four tools over stdio AND Streamable HTTP).
- Real-Electron e2e (0.1.2): MCP client → HTTP → IPC → renderer graph —
  `data-node-id` on all 12 elements (DOM = SSR, via the canonical
  `renderProducingProcess` loop), `provident.dispatch` on `inc` mutates the
  graph + re-renders both views with engine-derived `dirtied`
  (`["node-5","node-3","node-1"]`), engine `requestId` dedup echoes the first
  report (no re-fire), `event.value` echo works, node state works.
- Trio (this repo's gate): `npm test` green, `npm run typecheck` clean,
  `npm run build` clean.
