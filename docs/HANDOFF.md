# Provident-Electron → Preempt-Providence Issue Handoff

This is the issue-handoff document (AGENTS.md item 7): the finished catalogue
of requirement gaps / defects discovered while consuming `provident-ssr` as an
Electron/MCP host. Each row is an issue candidate for the ORIGINAL project
(`Preempt-Providence`, adjacent folder). This repo does NOT fix the package —
the fix shapes below are upstream-owned.

Full catalogue: `docs/defects.md` (this file is the handoff assembly; defects.md
is the living tracker). Where relevant, "consumer workaround" = what
Provident-Electron does today so the gap is not blocking.

## Round 1 — REQ-GAP-1..7 (filed 2026-08-21): RESOLVED by provident-ssr 0.1.1

The upstream ran a three-agent change-analysis (`docs/specs/handoffs-review.md`)
and landed the accepted shapes in **provident-ssr 0.1.1**. Disposition per
issue:

| Issue | 0.1.1 landing | This repo's adoption |
| --- | --- | --- |
| REQ-GAP-1 (inline handlers default modern) | **PASS-AS-DOCUMENTED** — FORMAT MARKER + ssr-synthetic-event.md §2.3 sentence | Demo bodies stay modern `(ctx, value)` |
| REQ-GAP-2 (css.id not a runtime lookup key) | **PASS-WITH-RESHAPE** — host-side index documented (css.id is a set; exclude destroyed/unplaced/prototype); NO engine surface | Runtime target resolver maps css.id → nodeId |
| REQ-GAP-3 (id collision + auto-mint) | **PASS-WITH-RESHAPE** — DEFECT #28 (mint-excluded from reverse), precedence doc (`css.id > props.id > mint`), opt-in `renderOptions.nodeIdAttribute` → `data-node-id` | **ADOPTED** — `emitElements(…, { nodeIdAttribute: true })`; every element carries `data-node-id` |
| REQ-GAP-4 (dispatch returns no dirtied / no idempotency) | **PASS** — `Supervisor.dispatchAndReport` ({results, dirtied}, engine-derived) + opt-in bounded `requestId` dedup + public `flush()` | **ADOPTED** — Runtime uses `dispatchAndReport`; host dedup removed |
| REQ-GAP-5 (re-emit loop boilerplate) | **PASS** — `renderProducingProcess` exported + `flush()` | Partial — see REQ-GAP-8 |
| REQ-GAP-6 (DomAdapter needs a DOM) | **CLOSED-ALREADY-ADDRESSED** | Renderer-hosts the graph; IPC bridge |
| REQ-GAP-7 (CSP silently skips string bodies) | **PASS-WITH-RESHAPE** — distinct `handler-body-eval-blocked` warn code + docs | CSP `'unsafe-eval'` stays (environment constraint); the failure is now detectable |

## Round 2 — REQ-GAP-8 (new, open): `renderProducingProcess` cannot thread `nodeIdAttribute`

- **Observed symptom**: the exported canonical re-emit loop
  (`renderProducingProcess(actionable, nodeById, adapter, prevMap)`) calls
  `emitElements(live, nodeById)` WITHOUT options, so a host adopting the loop
  cannot get the opt-in `data-node-id` traceability attribute that `emitElements`
  itself offers.
- **Reproduction**: call `renderProducingProcess`; the returned `els` carry no
  `data:node-id` op prop regardless of the caller wanting it.
- **Suspected root cause**: the 0.1.1 loop landed without the `renderOptions`
  parameter the handoffs-review Opening A/B explicitly planned ("the §B loop
  absorbs the A2 option in the same pass").
- **Proposed fix shape (upstream)**: add a `renderOptions`/`nodeIdAttribute`
  parameter to `renderProducingProcess` and thread it to `emitElements`; the
  ownership rules (per-tree prevMap, destroy-prune, caller drain, on-demand/P4)
  are unchanged. Small TDD change.
- **Consumer workaround**: the Runtime keeps an explicit emit-with-options loop
  (single emit `{nodeIdAttribute: true}` + the same op stream applied to the
  DOM and SSR adapters for parity).

## Handoff mechanics

- The upstream project receives these as issues (symptom / reproduction / root
  cause / proposed fix shape above). File them against
  `github.com/LittleKingsguard/Preempt-Providence` (or the project's chosen
  tracker). Round 1 issues are closed by 0.1.1; REQ-GAP-8 is the open follow-up.
- None of these require a behavior change in THIS repo to unblock; the consumer
  workarounds are in place.
- Environment-only findings (Node 18 vs Electron 43 tooling, ESM-main CJS
  requirement, MCP SDK stateless-HTTP wiring) are NOT package defects — they are
  recorded in `docs/decisions.md` / `docs/pending.md` for this repo's own
  maintenance.

## Verified state (the workarounds ARE proven)

- Unit: `tests/runtime.test.ts` (9) + `tests/engine-surfaces.test.ts` (4) —
  green (13 total).
- MCP e2e (both transports, standalone server): `tests/mcp-stdio-e2e.test.mjs`
  — green (all four tools over stdio AND Streamable HTTP).
- Real-Electron e2e (0.1.1): MCP client → HTTP → IPC → renderer graph —
  `data-node-id` on all 12 elements (DOM = SSR), `provident.dispatch` on `inc`
  mutates the graph + re-renders both views with engine-derived `dirtied`
  (`["node-5","node-3","node-1"]`), engine `requestId` dedup echoes the first
  report (no re-fire), `event.value` echo works, node state works.
- Trio (this repo's gate): `npm test` green, `npm run typecheck` clean,
  `npm run build` clean.
