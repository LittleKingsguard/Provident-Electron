// Contract: `docs/specs/gsession.md` (FILED 2026-09-27, 971 lines, the A-d3 unit,
// `SCH-2` ADOPTED-RESHAPED). The module to be built later is
// `src/shared/gesture-session.ts` (`§0A` ruling note 1 names BOTH paths — this
// file's path is confirmed there: "the module path is `src/shared/gesture-session.ts`,
// and the test file is `tests/gesture-session.test.ts`").
//
// Binding sections read IN FULL before authoring: the `CURRENT STATE` block, `§0`
// (the fourteen recorded rulings) and `§0A` (the TWELVE dated ruling notes —
// CONTRACT, not commentary), the `⟶ ARCHITECT APPROVAL` block (the FIVE formerly
// open items, now ruled: `reset` IS a session terminal · THE SESSION INVOKES
// `commit` · POINTER-AGNOSTIC TERMINATION · a repeat `install` is a first-config-wins
// NO-OP returning `false` with NO event-source call · the count seam is the
// module's own `stats()`/`gesture()`), the Layer declaration (five honesty anchors),
// `§1` (scope, items 1–9), `§2.1` (the surface + the EXPORT CENSUS `4 + 8 = 12` +
// the delegate clause), `§2.2` (the ten prohibitions `P-1`..`P-10`), `§2.3` (items
// 1–8: attachment / window / one-at-a-time / terminals / commit / capture / dispose /
// the FOUR-STATE machine), `§2.4` (items 1–8: opaque events / identity / one gesture /
// monotonic id / connectivity / unusable source / no value validation / nothing
// survives), `§2.5` (the delegate signature list — eleven items, "nothing else
// exists"), `§2.6` (the seven sibling properties + the `F-1` split `F-11`/`F-12`),
// `§3.1` (`M-1`..`M-17`), `§3.2` (`F-1`..`F-12`), `§3.3` (`I-1`..`I-13`),
// `§3.4` (the static rows `R-1`..`R-9`), `§3.5` (the existence rows `R-10`/`R-11`),
// `§4` (`§4.1` the red statement, `§4.2` the authoring order, `§4.3` what the red is
// NOT, `§4.4` the nine stop conditions `S-1`..`S-9`, `§4.5` the delegation gate),
// `§5.1` (diff scope + the DENIED set), `§5.2` (the four legs), `§5.3` (the DONE
// row's ELEVEN items), **`§5.5.1` (the typed Property register — ALL ELEVEN rows,
// executed here, `396` = `58+32+36+30+24+30+40+30+32+24+60`, seed `20260927`,
// caps `≤100`/row · `≤400` total · stop-after-5-consecutive-failures)**,
// `§5.5.2` (the honesty block + the pool-versus-boundary check), `§5.5.3` (the
// attempt arithmetic with its terms, and the reconciled terms `94→24`, `60→58`),
// `§6` (the three falsifications), `§7` (the fifteen honest statements),
// `§7a`/`§7a.1` (**now `0` open** — all five ruled), `§8`, and `§3a`/`§3b` at the
// END (the adversarial SEED set — the `A-*` rows belong to the LATER pass and NONE
// is authored here; `§3b` is EMPTY BY CONSTRUCTION).
//
// LAYER: **[T] lifecycle and CALL COUNTS over arguments.** This unit touches no DOM
// at all — not even `src/shared/dom-shim.ts` (layer declaration anchor 2): the
// ELEMENT is an argument, the EVENT SOURCE is an argument, and the listeners are
// observed through the argument-supplied recorder. **No row below asserts a
// rendered-geometry, layout, paint, coordinate or click-retargeting-in-a-browser
// property** (`I-11`, `R-8`): `§5.2` offers no `[U]` row (structurally: the module
// is imported by no `src/**` file — `R-7`) and claims no `[D]` row (`F-12` is
// `PRECONDITION-GATED` on `U-DIVERGENCE-EXT`, ledger row `C2` — `R-11`).
//
// THE COUNT SEAM IS THE MODULE'S OWN (`§0A` note 12, `M-15`): every count row below
// reads `stats()`/`gesture()` — the session's own monotonic counters — BESIDE the
// recorder's call log. **No row in this file asserts a count by trusting a
// test-authored spy alone** (the `RCA-4` self-verified-green anti-pattern the
// architect's ruling 5 closed): where a row reads the injected `commit` callback's
// own count it asserts the session's reported count in the SAME attempt and requires
// the two to agree.
//
// **THIS FILE IS THE UNIT'S RED SET (`§4.1`) AND NOTHING ELSE.** It is authored
// FIRST and RUN before any implementation: `src/shared/gesture-session.ts` does not
// exist, so every clause row, every static row and every register row fails on the
// module-absent boundary. **No `src/**`, `scripts/**`, `package.json` or spec file is
// created or modified by this pass.**
//
// THE IMPORT BOUNDARY (`§4.1`, the repo's established technique — an `fs` existence
// probe plus a RUN-TIME-COMPUTED specifier resolved through a dynamic
// `import(/* @vite-ignore */ …)`): every row fails as a **LABELLED ASSERTION** naming
// the absent module, never as a collection error that would take the whole red set
// down. `PRE-1` proves the mechanism itself resolves, against an EXISTING module.
//
// LEG 4 (`§5.2` leg 4): `R-6(b)` asserts the EIGHT TYPE-ONLY names of `§2.1`
// (`EventSource`, `GestureElement`, `GestureHandle`, `GestureOptions`,
// `GestureOptionsInput`, `SessionOptions`, `SessionStats`, `GestureStats`), and an
// imported type name is erased at run time — so the honest leg is a standalone strict
// `tsc` over THIS file. At RED time that leg reports the module-absent boundary
// (`TS2307`) and nothing else. **The `TS2307` diagnostic is NOT suppressed** (no
// `@ts-ignore` anywhere below): suppressing it would make the type-only export claim
// unfalsifiable.
//
// AUTHORED ORDER (`§4.2`): the `§3.5` existence/precondition rows `R-10`/`R-11`
// FIRST (they are the red's own premise and are evaluable before the module exists),
// then the `§3.4` static rows `R-9`/`R-1`..`R-8`, then the invariants `I-1`..`I-13`,
// then `M-1`..`M-17`, then `F-1`..`F-11` (**`F-12` is NOT authored as a passing row —
// `§3.2`/`S-6`**), then the `§5.5.1` register rows IN REGISTER ORDER
// (`P-GS-IM-1` · `P-GS-IM-2` · `P-GS-IM-3` · `P-GS-IM-4` · `P-GS-IM-5` ·
// `P-GS-IM-6` · `P-GS-SM-1` · `P-GS-SM-2` · `P-GS-SM-3` · `P-GS-TP-1` ·
// `P-GS-TP-2`), then the register's own status row. The `describe` blocks below are
// in that order; NOTHING is renumbered.
//
// TWO AS-FILED CLAUSES ARE REPORTED IN PLACE RATHER THAN GUESSED, and neither weakens
// a row (see `RED-RUN FINDINGS` at the foot of this file for both, in full):
//   · `§4.1`'s sentence "plus the static rows that can already be evaluated
//     (`R-2`/`R-3`/`R-5`/`R-7`/`R-9`/`R-11`)" calls `R-2`/`R-3`/`R-5`/`R-7`
//     evaluable-before-the-module while `§3.4` defines all four as scans OF the
//     module file — and `R-7` HERE IS the diff-scope row (`§3.4 R-7`), which the
//     sibling specs' numbering does not carry at all. The `§3.4` table governs
//     (this spec's own rows are enumerated there, and `§3.4`'s "What these nine rows
//     do NOT do" block is explicit); the stale `§4.1` list is reported.
//   · `§3.5 R-10`'s RED form ("at the moment the red set is AUTHORED and RUN,
//     `src/shared/gesture-session.ts` does not exist") governed AT RED TIME, when THIS
//     WAS the red run — and `§3.5 R-10`'s own text says a FAIL of it is meaningful
//     ("if the module EXISTS before the red run, this row FAILS and the `RCA-1` red
//     order is broken — the pass that finds it must REPORT the inversion rather than
//     proceed"). **THE INVERSION WAS REPORTED, NOT PROCEEDED PAST** (the red record is
//     in `docs/next-steps.md`'s `E6` row: 66 red / 10 pass, register stopped at
//     `P-GS-IM-1`). The row was then RE-SCOPED to `§3.5 R-10`'s own GREEN form (its
//     second half, which "governs AT GREEN TIME") by the green-time red-set-repair pass
//     of 2026-09-27, exactly as the sibling units' module-absence rows were; the
//     red-run census is kept as PROVENANCE in the row.

// implementing a source typed `EventSource` must be able to opt in TYPE-LEGALLY —
// and **this file does not compile while the module's `EventSource` lacks the
// member**. `§5.2` leg 4 (the standalone strict `tsc` over THIS file) is therefore

// excludes `tests/**` and leg 2 never reads this file (`§5.2` leg 2's NAMED LIMIT).
//
// The `TS2307`/excess-property diagnostics this produces are NOT suppressed

// make the declaration claim unfalsifiable.

// **⟶ RECORDED 2026-09-27 (`ADV-GS-17`, THE GATE-4 CLOSURE): THE TYPE-LEVEL RED HAS

// the member — the expected diagnostic is `error TS2353: Object literal may only specify
// known properties, and 'capturePointer' does not exist in type 'EventSource'`"*. **THE

// Three seam states had NO row before this pass. They are §3/`§2.1` clause rows (not
// register rows): none of them is a `§5.5.1` attempt, and the declared register terms,
// the `396` total, the seed and the caps are UNTOUCHED by this block.
//   · `ADV-GS-16` — **THE RED OF THIS PASS.** `§2.1`'s `SessionStats.gestures` cell reads
//     *"Successful `begin` calls, instance-lifetime"*, `§2.4` item 4 has the handle `id`
//     *"start at `1`, increment on every **successful** `begin`"*, and `M-2` puts the first
//     gesture's handle at `id === 1` — while the LANDED module consummates the counter and
//     the id BEFORE `onStart` runs, so a `begin` whose `onStart` throws (it cleans up and
//     RETHROWS, `§2.3` item 1(d)) still counts as a gesture and consumes an id. The row
//     asserts the CLAUSE and is therefore RED until the module side moves the increment.
//   · `ADV-GS-26` — the SOURCE-SUPPLIED capture member's throw. `§2.1`'s
//     `EventSource.capturePointer` doc is explicit that a throw from it is SWALLOWED like
//     the source's other callables (`§2.4` item 6), and `§2.3` item 6's count is unchanged
//     by it. No row drove it.
//   · `ADV-GS-22(a)` — the `commit`-ABSENT terminal. **THE ADJUDICATED READING (carried by
//     this pass and by the parallel SpecWriter pass): `committed` is the
//     COMMITTING-TERMINAL discriminator — `true` for `end`/`reset`, `false` for `cancel` —
//     and it is INDEPENDENT of whether a `commit` callback was installed; `stats().commits`
//     counts the session's actual `commit` invocations and therefore stays `0` when no

 *  CONTRADICTORY: it gave `21` cells the code `'ok'` and then applied REFUSAL-INERTNESS
 *  assertions to those same cells, `6` BEGIN cells demanded `'busy'` in state/idle states
 *  where `F-6`/`F-7`/`F-8`/`M-16` and this row's OWN trailing precedence assertion demand

 *  where `P-GS-SM-1`'s `absent` row demands `'no-gesture'`). The declared outcome of a
 *  cell is now derived from the CONTRACT'S OWN precedence, stated in the two clauses the
 *  row already asserts:
 *
 *  1. **THE STATE IS CHECKED FIRST, WITH `'disposed'` OUTRANKING `'not-installed'`**
 *     (`§2.3` item 7(3)): in states `(5)`/`(6)` every call shape reports `'disposed'`.
 *  2. **THEN `'busy'` OUTRANKS THE INSTALLATION AND CONNECTIVITY CHECKS** (`§2.4` item 5,
 *     and this row's own second precedence clause): while a gesture is active, `begin`
 *     reports `'busy'`, never `'disconnected'`.
 *  3. **THEN `'not-installed'`** for a `begin` on an element this session (not) installed:
 *     the `absent` state `(1)`, the unusable source `(7)`, and the cross-session case
 *     `(9)` (§2.4 item 6: `install` returned `false` with NO ledger entry, so the element
 *     is not installed HERE), then `'disconnected'` for the exact-`false` seam `(8)`.
 *  4. **THEN `'no-gesture'` for a terminal with no active gesture** (`§2.3` item 4 —
 *     `P-GS-SM-1`'s `absent` row states the same), **`'stale'` for a terminal carrying a
 *     handle that is not the active gesture's** (state `(4)`).
 *
 *  **A CELL WHOSE CALL LEGITIMATELY SUCCEEDS CARRIES NO CODE — `'ok'` IS NOT A CODE A
 *  SUCCESS PROVES.** `§2.1` declares `BeginResult` as a discriminated union whose success
 *  ARM HAS NO `code` MEMBER AT ALL (`{ok:true, gesture}`), so a `begin` success is
 *  asserted by its `ok`/state, never by a code; and a SUCCESSFUL TERMINAL is a
 *  COMMITTING terminal (`§2.3` item 4: `end`/`reset` ⇒ **exactly one** commit,
 *  `committed:true`), so those cells assert their OWN counts and are exempt from the
 *  refusal-inertness assertions — which belong to REFUSALS only (`§2.3` item 4's last

// pass's own record, kept in the artifact so the audit reads it beside the tables.
// ===========================================================================
//
// FINDING 1 — REPORTED, NOT GUESSED: `§4.1`'s as-filed list of "the static rows that
// can already be evaluated (`R-2`/`R-3`/`R-5`/`R-7`/`R-9`/`R-11`)" contradicts `§3.4`,
// which defines `R-2`/`R-3`/`R-5`/`R-7` as scans OF the module file (evaluable only once
// it exists — exactly what `§3.5 R-10` records) and which numbers the diff-scope row as
// `R-7` (the sibling specs number their diff-scope rows `R-4`/`R-8`), while `R-9` here is
// the absent-page-design probe. `§3.4`'s own table and its closing block ("What these
// nine rows do NOT do") GOVERN; the stale `§4.1` list is not followed for `R-2`/`R-3`/
// `R-5`/`R-7`, and no row was weakened to match it. The only module-independent static
// rows in this file are `R-9` (the page-design probe) and `R-11` (the `[D]` precondition),
// and both are authored EVALUABLE AND EXPECTED GREEN — a legitimate non-red, reported.
//
// FINDING 2 — `§3.5 R-10`'s RED form is asserted AT RED TIME by design (the row's own
// text: a FAIL is meaningful, because it would mean the `RCA-1` red order was inverted).
// Its GREEN form ("the module EXISTS and the unit-owned change set is EXACTLY the module
// + this test file") is recorded as PROVENANCE in the row, to be re-scoped by the
// green-time pass exactly as the sibling units' module-absence rows were.
//
// FINDING 3 — `§5.5.1 P-GS-TP-1`'s strategy cell states its `24` as `3 phases × 4 shapes
// × 2 functions` and then ALSO states that "`4 + 4 + 4 = 12` phase-shape drives; `12 × 2`
// functions = `24`" — i.e. it describes Phase A's domain (`4` option shapes × `2`
// callables), Phase B's (`4` source shapes × `2` functions) and Phase C's
// ("`10` methods × `5` hostile states, minus the `2` functions' Phase-B overlap") in
// terms that do not multiply to `4` shapes each. The DECLARED TERM `24` is what binds
// (`§5.5.3` prints it with its terms, and the caps compare against it), so this file
// drives `4` shapes × `2` drives in EACH of the three phases — which is the only reading
// under which the declared `24` is the sum of its own parts — and reports the residual
// wording ambiguity here instead of inventing a different count.
//
// NON-RED, LEGITIMATELY: `R-9` and `R-11` are green by construction (the file and the
// harness really are absent), and they are the two rows `§4.1` correctly names as
// evaluable before the module exists. They are NOT counted into the red set.

// GREEN-TIME RED-SET REPAIR (2026-09-27) — THE RECORD OF THIS PASS.
// `b1930d2`/`8e2c777`/`f36f605`/`2437727` class: the Implementer STOPPED rather than
// bend the module (the module is NOT mine and NOTHING in `src/**` was changed by this
// pass), and this pass verified each failing row against the MODULE and the CONTRACT.
// **EVERY REPAIR BELOW KEEPS THE ROW'S id, intent, clause citations and messages**, the
// register's declared rows, per-row terms, strategy ids, the `396` total, the seed and
// the pool are UNTOUCHED (`396` = `58+32+36+30+24+30+40+30+32+24+60`), and NO figure was
// changed except where it was provably wrong.
//
//  TEST-SIDE REPAIRS (each verified against the module AND the contract):
//   · A. HARNESS WIRING: `makeHarness` accepted `installOptions` and NEVER USED IT, so
//        `M-9`/`M-11`/`M-12`/`M-13`/`I-7`/`I-8`/`F-10` installed with NO options and their
//        hook/`capture` never reached the session. The harness now returns a
//        `sessionInstall` that threads the harness's own `installOptions` into
//        `install` (§2.5 item 2), with an explicit override for the rows that need a
//        per-element config. `M-7`/`M-8` (which install explicitly) stayed green.
//   · B. HOOK MERGE: `hookOptions(log, extra)` spread `extra` FIRST and then overwrote
//        `onStart`/`onMove`/`onEnd`/`onCancel`, silently DISCARDING the caller's hook —
//        `F-3`(a) observed no throw and `I-12b`'s `reentrant` stayed empty. The caller's
//        hook is now COMPOSED (recorder first, caller second) so the caller's hook IS the
//        one invoked and the recorder is still observed.
//   · C. `F-8`'s "unusable" TABLE mixed CALLABILITY with THROWING: it listed a source
//        whose `off` THROWS and one whose `isConnected` THROWS and demanded
//        `install → false`, contradicting §2.4 item 6's exact definition (unusable =
//        not an object, or `on` not callable, or `off` not callable), §2.4 item 5 and
//        this row's own later half (the throwing `isConnected` must make the gesture
//        PROCEED). Both throwing sources are CALLABLE and therefore USABLE; their drives
//        are kept and now assert the clauses that govern them (§2.3 item 7(4)'s per-call
//        catch; §2.4 item 5's swallowed reading).
//   · D. `I-12` asserted `[gestures, commits] === [2, 2]` while the SECOND gesture was
//        never terminated — a commit is issued by a TERMINAL (§2.3 item 4), so the count
//        is `[2, 1]`, the same count `I-2`/`M-4`/`M-10`/`P-GS-SM-3` assert. The figure
//        moved; nothing else did.
//   · E. `I-12b`'s "hook-disposed ⇒ ZERO commits" limb contradicted §2.3 item 4's
//        exactly-one for the terminal's own commit. The clause is `without a FURTHER
//        commit`, so the row asserts ONE (the `end` terminal's) and the session's own
//        counter agreeing.
//   · F. `P-GS-IM-3`'s expectation map was INTERNALLY CONTRADICTORY (it gave 21 cells
//        `'ok'` and then applied refusal-INERTNESS to them; six `begin` cells demanded
//        `'busy'` in idle states; three terminal cells demanded `'not-installed'`). It is
//        now DERIVED FROM §2.3 item 4's closed union and the two precedence clauses the
//        row itself asserts: a successful `begin` carries NO `code` (§2.1's
//        `BeginResult` success arm has no such member), a successful terminal commits
//        exactly the declared number of times, and the inertness facts bind REFUSALS.
//        Cell counts, the `36` term and the strategy id are unchanged.
//   · G. `P-GS-IM-1`'s `reconcile(rec, 58)` against a `59`-observation drive:
//        §5.5.3 states `58` is DELIBERATELY CONSERVATIVE and `PRE-4` asserts only
//        `58 ≤ 59`. The DECLARED term is now asserted as the declared figure AND the
//        MEASURED count as its own reported number, so neither is substituted for the
//        other and no real observation is discarded to match a conservative declaration.
//   · H. `P-GS-IM-4`: the `dispose()` terminal's tail demanded the tracking three while
//        §2.3 item 7(2) ALSO requires `dispose()` to detach the START listener —
//        the start-listener detach cannot be both before and after `onCancel`. The
//        `dispose()` cell's declared tail is the FOUR-call pattern
//        (`off(move)`, `off(end)`, `off(cancel)`, `off(start)`), and the other five
//        terminals keep the tracking three.
//   · I. `P-GS-IM-5`: the row pushed `source.captures.length` six times and read the
//        array AFTER the lifecycle, so every reading was the FINAL count and the
//        pre-establishment stages were unsatisfiable for an opted-in flag (while the
//        row's own `expectedPerStage[0] = 0` was right). Every stage's reading is now
//        SNAPSHOTTED at its own moment, and the row additionally asserts the
//        `0,0,1,1,1,1` progression (a constant reading is a FAIL).
//   · J. `P-GS-IM-6`: `expectedDetaches` was `0` for the IDLE gesture state, so
//        shapes (1)/(2) × idle × `dispose()` demanded `removed === 0` while `M-13`/`I-5`
//        (§2.3 item 7(2)) require `dispose()` to detach EVERY start listener of every
//        installed control. The expectation is the number of listeners the session
//        attached.
//   · K. `P-GS-SM-1`: (i) `installed-idle × begin` compared `result.code` with `'ok'`
//        although a success carries NO `code`; (ii) `active × end(el, staleHandle)`
//        called a bare `begin` while a gesture was ACTIVE (refused `'busy'`), so no stale
//        handle could exist and the ACTIVE handle was passed. The stale handle is now
//        built from a PREVIOUS gesture (terminate, re-establish, keep the first handle),
//        and `active × begin(el)` declares `'busy'` — the code §2.3 item 8 declares.
//   · L. `P-GS-SM-3`: the recorded-handler paths read `result?.committed` off
//        `source.fire()`'s `null` return. The row now reads the SESSION's own report
//        (`stats().commits` / `stats().lastCode` — §0A note 12's count seam) for those
//        paths, and the `(h)` throwing-`commit` limb is asserted where a commit EXISTS:
//        the `'pointercancel'` path declares ZERO commits (§2.3 item 4), so it has no
//        commit call to throw.
//   · M. `P-GS-TP-2`: the row's OWN no-read probe spelled its question
//        `'readCount' in probe`, which fires the pool member `(16)` Proxy's throwing
//        `has` trap — the ROW read the event and broke on its own instrument. The probe
//        now uses `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` (no proxy trap is fired), caught.
//   · N. `R-10` was authored in its RED form only; the module has landed, so the row is
//        re-scoped to §3.5 R-10's own GREEN form (module PRESENT — the two canonical
//        artifacts are the module + this test file, no OTHER `gesture-session*` path on
//        disk, non-vacuity asserted first) with the red-run census kept as PROVENANCE.
//
//  THE CAPTURE RESOLUTION (landed here, not re-litigated): the RULED form of §2.3 item 6
//  is that the session calls A CAPTURE METHOD THE SOURCE SUPPLIES, so the module's bytes
//  carry NO DOM capture-method token while the capability and the invocation stay real.
//  The harness's recorder therefore exposes its capture entry point under the
//  module-neutral name `capturePointer`, and every capture row asserts the COUNT
//  (exactly one on an opted-in establishment, zero otherwise) and NEVER the module's
//  spelling. `R-3`(2) and `F-11` keep their scans EXACTLY as they are (they must still
//  fail a module whose bytes name the token), and `PRE-5` is the POSITIVE CONTROL that
//  the count rows still fail a module that SKIPS the capture.
//
//  **⟶ RECORDED 2026-09-27 (`ADV-GS-17`, THE GATE-4 CLOSURE): THE MODULE-SIDE FIX LANDED.**
//  The as-filed paragraph read: *"**THE ONE REMAINING RED IS MODULE-SIDE, AND IT IS NOT MINE
//  TO FIX.** The landed module discovers the supplied capture method by the DOM method's own
//  NAME — `readMember(seam, 'setPointerCapture')` (`src/shared/gesture-session.ts` line 276)
//  — which is the token `R-3`(2) and `F-11` must reject … **The fix is ONE identifier on the
//  module side** … **NOTHING in `src/**` was edited by this pass.**"* **THE FIX HAS LANDED:
//  the module now discovers the capability by the module-neutral, source-supplied name
//  (`readMember(seam, 'capturePointer')`), so `R-3`(2)/`F-11` keep their scans intact and the
//  capture rows drive a real, source-supplied capability.** The as-filed text is kept here as
//  provenance; **this pass edited nothing in `src/**` either.**
//
// (The full as-filed paragraph, kept verbatim so nothing is silently rewritten: *"THE ONE
// REMAINING RED IS MODULE-SIDE, AND IT IS NOT MINE TO FIX. The landed module discovers the
// supplied capture method by the DOM method's own NAME — `readMember(seam,
// 'setPointerCapture')` — which is the token `R-3`(2) and `F-11` must reject, and which no
// source-supplied surface in this harness provides. The fix is ONE identifier on the module
// side: discover it under the source-supplied name the ruling implies (`'capturePointer'` —
// or any module-neutral name the implementer prefers, in which case this harness's recorder
// and `F-10`'s one asserted log entry must use that same name; `PRE-5` prints both ends).
// NOTHING in `src/**` was edited by this pass."*)
// ===========================================================================

// ===========================================================================
// ADV-GS-2 — THE TRACKING-ATTACH REFUSAL: **THE ROW IS AUTHORED (2026-09-27).**
//
// THE FINDING WAS REAL AND THE MODULE FIX IS LANDED: `begin` now checks the three
// tracking `on` results, rolls the successful attaches back, refuses with the EXISTING
// closed-domain code `'not-installed'` (no eighth code member is invented — `§4.4 S-9`),
// commits nothing, and leaves the element installed so a transient seam failure is
// retryable. Before the fix a seam that could not perform a `pointermove` attach could
// still report `{ok:true}` with a live handle while NO tracking listener existed — a
// gesture the session could never finish, which latched the consumer `busy` for the rest
// of the session.
//
// WHY THE ROW WAS OWED RATHER THAN WRITTEN (kept as provenance, in the past tense):
// driving the refusal needs an `on` call that THROWS, and in this harness every `on` the
// session makes goes through the mock seam's recorder — a throw injected from a row-level
// source object never reaches the session (measured: the row read `refused.ok === true`,
// i.e. the refusal path was not taken). The recorder has a `failOff` hook and the
// symmetric `failOn` hook was added for exactly this; wiring it to a real refusal needed
// one more pass through this file's seam, which the gate-4 closure did not have budget for.
//
// **AUTHORED — THE ROW IS `ADV-GS-2`** (`describe('ADV-GS-2 — the tracking-attach refusal
// (the gate-4 regression row)')`, placed between the `F-*` block and the `PRE` harness
// block): `h.source.failOn` is wired to the recorder's own `on` for the `pointermove`
// type, and the row asserts **(i)** the refusal code `'not-installed'` (NO eighth code
// member — `§4.4 S-9`), **(ii)** the roll-back, measured BOTH from the recorder's
// `attached` map (`listenerCount === 1`, `typeMultiset === ['pointerdown']`) AND from its
// log by the same sequential pairing reader `I-5`/`M-13`/`P-GS-IM-6` use, **(iii)** that
// NOTHING commits (`h.commits` empty and `stats().commits === 0`), and **(iv)** that the
// element stays INSTALLED and the SAME element then establishes normally once `failOn` is
// flipped off, driven to its `end` terminal with the commit count for that path asserted
// as ONE. **`§5.5.1`'s declared attempts are untouched by this row** (it is a
// `§3`/gate-4 regression row, not a register row), and **the `396` total, its eleven
// terms, the seed, the caps and every strategy id are unchanged**.
//
// TWO FINDINGS THE AUTHORED ROW MEASURED AND REPORTED (neither bent):
//   · the recorder logs an `on` ATTEMPT before the configured throw, so the roll-back's
//     two detaches for never-completed attaches still pair with their own recorded
//     attempts — the log stays BALANCED (`I-5`'s sentence is NOT contradicted here),
//     while the `attached` map holds only the start listener. Asserted, not over-claimed.
//   · the refused `begin`'s counter consumption — **now `ADV-GS-15` below, and the row
//     asserts the CLAUSE, not the measured figure** (the remand of 2026-09-27).
//
// **⟶ `ADV-GS-15` — THE REFUSED `begin` MUST NOT CONSUME A GESTURE (RECORDED
// 2026-09-27, the remand that CORRECTS THIS ROW).** THE CONTRADICTION, NAMED: **the
// clause** — `§2.1`'s `SessionStats.gestures` doc cell reads *"Successful `begin` calls,
// instance-lifetime"* and `§2.3`'s refusal clauses (`§2.3` item 1(b) for a repeat/refused
// path, and the refusal of a `begin` whose tracking attach cannot be made) create **NO**
// gesture — while **the measured module (`src/shared/gesture-session.ts`, READ-ONLY in
// this pass) increments `counters.gestures` BEFORE the three tracking `on` attaches are
// checked and BEFORE the capture call**, so a REFUSED `begin` reads `gestures: 1` and one
// real gesture thereafter reads `2` (and the refused attempt consumes the gesture id, so
// the first REAL gesture is handed id `2` — against `M-2`'s *"the handle's `id === 1`"*
// for the session's first gesture). **THE FIX IS MODULE-SIDE AND IS OWED TO THE
// IMPLEMENTER'S NEXT PASS: the gesture counter (and the id it feeds) must be
// incremented only by a `begin` that ESTABLISHES** — after the tracking-attach check,
// beside the capture call. **This row therefore asserts the CLAUSE and is INTENTIONALLY
// RED until that fix lands: the red is a PINNED CONTRACT VIOLATION, NOT a broken test.**
// A reader who sees this row fail must read it as *the module owes the fix*, never as
// *the expectation is stale* — and must NOT re-tune the row to the measured figure.
//
// **⟶ RECORDED 2026-09-27 LATER THE SAME DAY (`ADV-GS-17`, THE GATE-4 CLOSURE): THE FIX
// HAS LANDED, AND THE ADV-GS-2 ROW IS GREEN.** The as-filed text above is kept verbatim as
// the record of what was owed; the landed module
// (`src/shared/gesture-session.ts`) now increments `counters.gestures` — and derives
// `record.id` from it — AFTER the three tracking `on` results are checked and beside the
// capture call, so a REFUSED `begin` reads `gestures: 0`, the next real gesture reads `1`
// and is handed `id: 1`. **No row was re-tuned to the pre-fix measured figures**; the red
// was discharged by the module-side fix, which is the only way it was ever allowed to
// clear. (The SAME clause, on the `onStart`-throws path rather than the refused-attach
// path, is `ADV-GS-16`'s row — and THAT one is still red, because the increment still
// precedes the `onStart` hook.)
//
// Tracked in `docs/pending.md` §H with this reasoning.

// ===========================================================================
// **⟶ RECORDED 2026-09-27 — THE TEST-SIDE OWED ITEMS PASS (`D-1`, `D-2`,
// `D-12`, `D-13`, AND THE TWO FLAGGED DRIVE-LEVEL CORRECTIONS).**
//
// WHAT THIS PASS LANDED, EACH WITH ITS SITE:
//   · **`D-1` — THE TYPED `EventSource` FIXTURE AND THE TWO ROWS.** `typedEventSourceRecord`
//     (module scope, near the `import type` block) builds a source TYPED AS THE MODULE'S OWN
//     IMPORTED `EventSource` carrying the declared member `capturePointer?(element)`; `M-7b`
//     (§3.1, beside `M-7`/`M-8`) asserts EXACTLY ONE call reaching that member, carrying the
//     gesture's OWN element, AFTER the three tracking `on` calls and AFTER `isConnected`; and
//     `M-8b` asserts the DECLARED DEGRADATION on a capture-LESS, GENUINELY FROZEN source
//     (zero capture calls, no throw, no diagnostic, the gesture establishes, opens the three
//     tracking listeners, terminates normally at the recording `pointerup` with EXACTLY ONE
//     commit, and the baseline back to `1`).
//   · **`D-2` — THE `ADV-GS-2` ROW** (`describe('ADV-GS-2 — the tracking-attach refusal …')`,
//     between the `F-*` block and `PRE`), with the parked comment block at the file's end
//     UPDATED IN PLACE (reasoning kept, the row marked AUTHORED with its name/date/site).
//   · **`D-12`(`a`)** — `P-GS-IM-6`'s second-`dispose()` limb now asserts the report SHAPE and
//     the retained-state facts and states in place that the FALSIFIABLE drive is `M-13`'s.
//   · **`D-12`(`b`)** — the two MISSING FIXTURES (`(16)`'s ABSENT-MEMBER source, `(18)`'s
//     GENUINELY FROZEN source) now exist and are asserted in `PRE-4`; `(17)` is a real class
//     instance; the table carries a `distinctKey` per configuration so the distinct-input
//     figure is DERIVED (printed) rather than restated, and the DECLARED `15` is printed
//     BESIDE the derived figure in the register row. **⟶ CARRIED FURTHER BY `ADV-GS-18`
//     (the gate-4 closure):** the as-filed row still HARD-CODED its derived figure (`12`) and
//     built all five "single-hook" configurations from ONE all-hooks fixture; the row now
//     computes three figures from the table (the `20` declared configurations, the `16`
//     distinct LABELS, the `13` distinct MODULE-OBSERVABLE inputs via `im1ObservableKey`) and
//     `(6)`–`(10)` plus `(20)` really build/install what their ids say.
//   · **`D-12`(`c`)** — `P-GS-IM-1`'s row/stage/message text now reads the `end`-terminal drive
//     (the `reset`/`cancel` counts named as `P-GS-IM-4`'s), and `P-GS-IM-5`'s declarations and
//     messages read `6` stage POSITIONS beside the declared `24`. **⟶ CORRECTED BY
//     `ADV-GS-19` (the gate-4 closure):** the as-filed text continued *"`/ `5` distinct
//     observations per flag = `20` distinct observations"*, a figure hard-coded in the row
//     while `§5.5.1`'s own prose names TWO aliased stage pairs — so the derived figure is now
//     `6 − 2 = 4` readings per flag × `4` flags = **`16`**, DERIVED from the declared
//     `IM5_STAGE_ALIAS_PAIRS` table and measured inside the stage loop. The declared `24` is
//     UNMOVED.
//   · **`D-13` — THE THREE MISSING CONTROLS, each inside the row it belongs to:** `R-5`'s
//     runtime-ownership control (a stand-in that hands the source an element which was NOT
//     the argument FAILS the row's own check); `F-11`'s ASSEMBLED-TOKEN positive control (a
//     template-substituted split spelling is invisible to the raw view and caught by the
//     assembled view, driven through the row's own rule list); and `PRE-5`'s ROW PREDICATE
//     control (`im5CountPredicateHolds`, extracted at module scope and shared with
//     `P-GS-IM-5`, REJECTS the capture-skipping stand-in's zero and ACCEPTS the counts the
//     row requires).
//   · **`M-15`'s drive correction** — the row now compares `stats().sourceCalls` against the
//     count of NON-THROWING log entries (the recorder's `threwAt` set carries the sequences
//     of the calls that threw), and a SECOND ARM drives a really-throwing tracking attach so
//     the corrected rule is falsifiable: the raw logged total is strictly GREATER than the
//     reported count, and the reported count equals the non-throwing count.
//   · **`F-5`'s drive correction** — the drive is now the UNAMBIGUOUS IDLE case the corrected
//     clause bounds (`installed-idle`, NOT disposed, `gesture() === null`, with a real handle
//     from a completed gesture), asserted before the four terminals.
//
// FINDINGS THIS PASS MEASURED AND DID NOT BEND (each carried, not smoothed over):
//   · **`D-1`'s TYPE-LEVEL RED HAS FLIPPED GREEN (`⟶ ADV-GS-17`, the gate-4 closure).**
//     The as-filed bullet read: *"`D-1`'s TYPE-LEVEL RED IS REAL AND STILL RED. `§5.2` leg 4
//     (…) reports EXACTLY ONE diagnostic — `error TS2353: Object literal may only specify
//     known properties, and 'capturePointer' does not exist in type 'EventSource'` — because
//     the module's `EventSource` (`src/shared/gesture-session.ts`) declares only `on`, `off`
//     and `isConnected?`. … The fix is one member on the MODULE side and is not this pass's
//     to make."* **THE FIX LANDED: the module's `EventSource` now declares
//     `capturePointer?(element: GestureElement): void`, and the module's capture read is
//     `readMember(seam, 'capturePointer')`.** The standalone strict `tsc` leg over THIS file
//     is **EXIT `0` with ZERO diagnostics** (re-run by this pass — `ADV-GS-17`), so the
//     member's red/green cycle is complete and the `TS2353` above is kept only as the
//     as-filed record. **Nothing in `src/**` was edited by this pass.**
//   · **`P-GS-IM-1`'s DECLARED DISTINCT-INPUT FIGURE IS `15`; THE TABLE NOW DERIVES
//     `16` LABELS AND `13` MODULE-OBSERVABLE INPUTS (`⟶ ADV-GS-18`, the gate-4 closure).**
//     The as-filed bullet read *"THE TABLE DERIVES `12` … 20 = 12 distinct + 8 aliases"*, and
//     that `12` was BOTH hard-coded in the assertion and contradicted by the table's own
//     printed aliasing list, because the FIVE "single-hook" configurations `(6)`…`(10)` were
//     all built from the SAME all-hooks fixture (so their ids described nothing they built)
//     and because `(20)`'s `secondElement` flag was declared and never used. **Three figures
//     are now COMPUTED in the row from the table:** the `20` declared configurations; the `16`
//     distinct `distinctKey` LABELS the table defines (including the two FIXTURE-ONLY labels
//     `(17)`'s class instance and `(18)`'s freeze); and the `13` distinct MODULE-OBSERVABLE
//     inputs, derived by building each configuration's source/options exactly as the drive
//     does and projecting only what the module can read (`im1ObservableKey` — under which
//     `(17)` and `(18)` read as `(12)`-shaped inputs, asserted as such). `(6)`–`(9)` now build
//     four GENUINELY single-hook inputs, `(10)` builds the all-hooks input, and `(20)` really
//     installs its second element. **The DECLARED `15` and the DECLARED term `58` are unmoved**
//     and the derived figures are printed BESIDE them (never substituted); this remains a
//     register-cell-vs-table disagreement, reported rather than tuned green.
//   · **`ADV-GS-15` — `ADV-GS-2`/`stats().gestures`: A REFUSED `begin` MUST NOT CONSUME A
//     GESTURE (the finding this pass measured, and the remand that CORRECTED THE ROW).** The
//     clause: `§2.1` declares `SessionStats.gestures` as *"Successful `begin` calls,
//     instance-lifetime"* (`§2.4` item 4: *"`id` starts at `1`, increments on every SUCCESSFUL
//     `begin`"*; `M-2`: *"the handle's `id === 1`"* for the first gesture) and `§2.3`'s refusal
//     clauses create NO gesture. The bytes THEN: the landed module incremented its gesture
//     counter BEFORE its tracking-attach check (and derived `record.id` from it), so a refused
//     `begin` read `gestures: 1`, a single real gesture then read `2`, and the first REAL
//     gesture was handed id `2`. **THE ROW ASSERTS THE CLAUSE — `gestures === 0` after the
//     refusal, `gestures === 1` and `handle.id === 1` after the retry — AND IS NOW GREEN: THE
//     MODULE-SIDE FIX LANDED** (`⟶ ADV-GS-17`, the gate-4 closure: the increment, and the
//     `record.id` it feeds, sit after the tracking-attach check beside the capture call).
//     The former text of this bullet asserted the MEASURED figure *beside* the clause, which
//     codified the violation instead of pinning the contract; that is the defect this remand
//     removes, and the red was discharged by the fix rather than by re-tuning the row. (The
//     same finding, stated at the row: the `ADV-GS-15` block above
//     `describe('ADV-GS-2 …')`.)
//   · **`ADV-GS-16` — THE SAME CLAUSE ON THE `onStart`-THROWS PATH, AND IT IS STILL RED.**
//     The refused-attach path is fixed, but `counters.gestures` is ALSO incremented before the
//     consumer’s `onStart` hook runs, so a `begin` whose `onStart` throws (it rolls the
//     tracking listeners back and RETHROWS) still counts as a gesture and consumes an id. The
//     row authored by this pass asserts the clause — measured on the landed bytes:
//     `{gestures after the throw: 1, gestures after the retry: 2, retry handle id: 2}` against
//     the required `{0, 1, 1}`. **This is the ONE red this pass reports**, and it is a PINNED
//     CONTRACT VIOLATION, not a broken test: the increment must move after the `onStart` call
//     (or the hook must run before the counters move) for the clause to hold.
//   · **`ADV-GS-2`'s roll-back LOG IS BALANCED, and that is measured not assumed:** the
//     recorder logs an `on` ATTEMPT before its configured throw, so the two detaches for
//     never-completed attaches still pair with their own recorded attempts (`pairOnOffCalls`
//     reports no unmatched `off`); the `attached` MAP, however, holds only the start listener.
//     `I-5`'s sentence is therefore NOT contradicted by this path, and the row says so.
//   · **`P-GS-IM-6`'s declared `30` / distinct `20` (DERIVED), `P-GS-IM-1`'s declared `58` /
//     meas. `59` / labels `16` / module-observable `13`, and `P-GS-IM-5`'s declared `24` /
//     distinct `16` (DERIVED), are the figures this file prints.** The `⟶ ADV-GS-18/19/20`
//     closure replaced the as-filed hard-coded distinct figures (`12`, `5`, `26`) with
//     DERIVED ones and recorded the reasons, so no row prints a figure its own table
//     contradicts. **No register id, term, strategy id, the `396` total, the seed or any cap
//     moved in this pass** — the DECLARED terms (`58`/`24`/`30`) are unmoved and are what the
//     caps are compared against.
