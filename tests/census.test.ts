// U-CENSUS · wave E · **THE RED SET** (RCA-1) — the `next-steps` row `E2`.
//
// Contract: `docs/specs/census.md` (FILED 2026-09-27, ~1730 lines, wave E's
// SECOND unit — `SCH-8`'s CENSUS HALF per architect ruling A-d4). The module to
// be built later is `src/shared/census.ts` — **the THREE exported names of
// `§2.1`'s block** (ONE value export `computeTrackVars` + TWO type declarations
// `ZoneId` · `TrackVars`; `1 + 2 = 3`; the doc-level aliases `SizeLookup` /
// `SpecLookup` are NOT exports and no row asserts them). `§3.4 R-2` is the row
// that pins the SET (never a bare count — `§4.4 S-3`).
//
// Binding sections read in full: `§0` (the twelve recorded rulings) and `§0A`
// (the TWELVE dated ruling notes — CONTRACT, not commentary; notes 11 and 12 are
// the ARCHITECT RULING landed 2026-09-27: "Non-revealed zones still exist, they
// just don't get displayed"), `Layer declaration`, `§1` (scope; the `U-GUTTER`
// / `U-RELOCATE` boundaries), `§2.1` (the surface + export census + the delegate
// clause), `§2.2` (the `H-r8` SIX-PROHIBITION table `P-1`..`P-6`), `§2.3`
// (items 1–6: the enumeration order, the census pass-through, the reveal gate,
// the two lookups, THE EXACT CALL COUNTS), `§2.4` (the three ledger clauses
// `C-A` · `C-B` · `C-C`), `§2.5` (the geometry boundary + the three-case `''`
// limitation), `§3.1` (`M-1`..`M-14`), `§3.2` (`F-1`..`F-6`), `§3.3`
// (`I-1`..`I-10`), `§3.4` (the STATIC rows `R-1`..`R-10`), `§3.5` (the EXISTENCE
// rows `R-11`..`R-13`), `§4.1`/`§4.2` (the red statement + the authoring order),
// `§4.3` (what the red is NOT), `§4.4` (`S-1`..`S-10`), `§5.1` (diff scope + the
// COMMIT-RANGE SCOPE RULE), `§5.2` (the legs; leg 4 = the standalone strict
// `tsc`), `§5.3` (the DONE row's eleven items), **`§5.5.1` (the typed Property
// register — all EIGHT rows, executed here, `248` = `68+36+24+14+30+10+30+36`,
// seed `20260927`, caps `≤100`/row · `≤400` total · stop-after-5)**, `§6`,
// `§7` (the honest statements; items 13/14 are the ruling's limitation + the
// sibling note), `§7a`/`§7a.1` (the EIGHT ambiguities — ALL EIGHT RULED; no row
// below re-opens one), `§8`, and `§3a`/`§3b` (the adversarial SEED set — the
// `A-*` rows belong to the LATER pass and NONE is authored here).
//
// LAYER: **[T] arithmetic / decision / delegation over arguments.** This unit
// touches no DOM at all, not even `src/shared/dom-shim.ts` (layer anchor 2): no
// element, no document, no shim member, no window, no IPC, no assembled app, no
// engine surface. **No row below asserts a rendered-geometry, CSS-validity,
// layout or paint property** (`I-8`, `R-6`, `§2.5`): `computeTrackVars` returns
// a RECORD OF STRINGS and whether a browser accepts, applies or paints any of
// them is **UNPROVABLE in this repo today** — `§5.2` offers no `[U]` row,
// structurally (the module is imported by no `src/**` file — `R-8`/`R-13`).
//
// **THIS FILE IS THE UNIT'S RED SET (`§4.1`) AND NOTHING ELSE.** It is authored
// FIRST and RUN before any implementation: `src/shared/census.ts` does not
// exist, so every clause row, every static row and every register row fails on
// the module-absent boundary. **No `src/**`, `scripts/**`, `package.json` or
// spec file is created or modified by this pass.**
//
// THE IMPORT BOUNDARY (`§4.1`, the repo's established technique — an `fs`
// existence probe plus a RUN-TIME-COMPUTED specifier resolved through a dynamic
// `import(/* @vite-ignore */ …)`): every row fails as a **LABELLED ASSERTION**
// naming the absent module / missing export, never as a collection error that
// would take the whole red set down. `PRE-1` proves the mechanism itself
// resolves, against an EXISTING pure module.
//
// THE DELEGATE SPY BOUNDARY (`§2.3` item 6; `I-4`; `P-CN-IM-4`): the module
// under test calls `isEmpty`/`trackFor` through its own `import … from
// './zones.js'`, so the ONLY way a row can count those calls is to intercept
// that specifier. `vi.mock('../src/shared/zones.js')` is proved (by this file's
// own `PRE-5` control) to reach a consumer that imports the same specifier, so
// the delegate calls are observed with their ARGUMENT TUPLES — and the rows that
// need the delegate's REAL bytes compare against a direct call to the same
// mocked delegate, while `PRE-6` drives the REAL module's exports so the
// U-ZONES semantics the expected values rest on are the landed ones.
//
// LEG 4 (`§5.2`): `R-2`(a) asserts the TYPE-ONLY names `ZoneId`/`TrackVars` are
// exported, and an imported type name is erased at run time — so the honest leg
// is a standalone strict `tsc` over THIS file. At RED time that leg reports the
// module-absent boundary (`TS2307`) and nothing else. **The `TS2307` diagnostic
// is NOT suppressed** (no `@ts-ignore`), because suppressing it would make that
// type claim unfalsifiable.
//
// AUTHORED ORDER (`§4.2` item 1): the `§3.5` existence rows `R-11`/`R-12`/`R-13`
// FIRST OF ALL (they are the red's own premise and are evaluable before the
// module exists), then `I-1`..`I-10`, then `M-1`..`M-14`, then `F-1`..`F-6`,
// then the `§3.4` static rows `R-1`..`R-10`, then the `§5.5.1` register rows in
// register order (`P-CN-IM-1` · `P-CN-IM-2` · `P-CN-IM-3` · `P-CN-IM-4` ·
// `P-CN-SM-1` · `P-CN-SM-2` · `P-CN-SM-3` · `P-CN-TP-1`), then the register's own
// status row. The `describe` blocks below are in that order; NOTHING is
// renumbered. The ruling's five falsifiers (`§0A` note 12 (a)..(e)) each carry a
// NAMED row of their own, and the register rows are the bounded executions.
//
// ONE SPEC CONTRADICTION IS REPORTED IN PLACE RATHER THAN GUESSED, and the row
// still falsifies the ruling — see the block above `P-CN-IM-2`'s drive: the
// `§5.5.1 P-CN-IM-2` strategy cell's per-attempt `[]` for its `v2` column
// (`revealed = () => false`, a CALLABLE predicate) contradicts `§0A` ruling note
// 11 (`C-A` is UNCONDITIONAL: a declined zone's key exists with `''`), the
// row's own `YES`-marked prose at `§5.5.1`'s dated confirmation ("the key is
// present with `''`, never omitted"), and `§6`'s ruling-falsifier paragraph
// ("a row that folds `v2` and `v3` into one expectation FAILS this spec's
// text"). The RULING text governs (§0A note 11 is the freshest contract text and
// its table changes no cell, count, term or strategy id); the stale cell is
// reported, not followed.
//
// ===========================================================================
// ⟶ GREEN-TIME REPAIR (2026-09-27) — the implementer's stop, the supervisor's
// verification, and the TestWriter's green-time pass. **The MODULE was NOT bent
// to satisfy any row: `src/shared/census.ts` is byte-for-byte the module the
// implementer landed, and every repair below is a ROW whose as-authored
// expectation was unsatisfiable or mis-derived.** Each repaired row keeps its id,
// its intent, its clause citations and its message (corrected to the current
// truth), and carries its own in-place `CORRECTED 2026-09-27` provenance block;
// no register id, strategy id, attempt term, seed, pool, draw or the `248` total
// moved, and no new row id exists. The thirteen repairs, with the clause each
// new form cites:
//   · `I-6` — the union rule is NARROWED to the CONSUMER-VOCABULARY class
//     (SUPERVISOR RULING: a union of two PRIMITIVE KINDS is legitimate; `§2.1`
//     requires `export type ZoneId = string | number`), with a positive control
//     that a vocabulary union still FAILS. `§2.2` P-1's wording is annotated by
//     the supervisor to name the exception.
//   · `M-4` — `delegate.isEmpty.length` (the DELEGATE's arity, 2) → the DELEGATE
//     LOG's length (`§2.3` item 6).
//   · `M-7` — `b`'s expectation mixed `a`'s size (5) with `b`'s emptiness; the
//     contracted value is `trackFor(SPEC_A, undefined, …)` (`§2.3` item 4,
//     `F-3`), and the duplicate zone's own last-occurrence value is asserted
//     beside it.
//   · `F-5` / `F-6` — the as-authored reading inverted the DELEGATE: `isEmpty`
//     answering `false` means NOT EMPTY (U-ZONES `§2.3` item 2), so the value is
//     the delegate's size+unit limb — obeying the old expectation would have
//     forced this unit to implement a delegate limb itself (§2.1's delegate
//     clause, `I-4`, `§3.4 R-1`, `§4.4 S-1`).
//   · `R-10` — re-scoped to the GREEN form its own cell already states (module
//     present + the unit-owned change set exactly the two artifacts + no stray
//     `census*` path), the RED premise kept as PROVENANCE (the `U-ZONES` `R-8`
//     model).
//   · `R-1`(b) — the duplication half now scans the CODE view of `§3.4 R-1`(b)
//     (comments stripped) BESIDE the `§4.4 S-2` normalized view, so its own
//     `String\s*\(`/`\s+`/`\.`/`\+` branches can actually match; the census-read
//     rule is narrowed to the clause's own scope ("applied to the census"), so
//     the zones enumeration's required `Map` branch is not a false positive.
//   · `R-1`(a) — a MASKED sibling: its rename control asserted the module's own
//     import form was ABSENT (`=== 0`) while `code` IS the module.
//   · `R-3` — the scope control applies the row's own ruled scope
//     (`stripComments`) and proves non-vacuity on the raw fixture.
//   · `R-4` — the node-realm rule's trailing `\b` made its `require\s*\(` branch
//     unmatchable; the boundary now binds the identifier branches only.
//   · `P-CN-SM-2` shape (3) — the declared key order is `['1','a']` (JS puts
//     INTEGER-LIKE own keys first) and the expectation is composed with the
//     MEMBER `1`, never its string image (`§0A` note 3, `§2.3` item 1).
//   · `P-CN-TP-1` member (30) — DECLARED as the DROP class with the `Symbol`
//     member: its `String()` image IS the throwing coercion, so NO implementation
//     can give it an own key (`§2.3` item 1 (iv)); the as-authored "one key"
//     expectation was unsatisfiable for every module.
//   · `P-CN-IM-4` drive (10) — fixed to the PINNED reading (a throwing predicate
//     ⇒ the WHOLE-call empty record: `§2.4 C-C` (g), `§2.3` item 3's annotation,
//     `F-2` (d), `§6`'s third falsification); the register cell's "3 keys, 2
//     `isEmpty` calls" reading CONTRADICTS those clauses and is REPORTED here
//     rather than followed (§6's outcome (b): the cell needs `SUPERSEDED`).
//
// ⟶ SUPERSEDED IN ONE NAMED RESPECT (the COERCION cycle, red half): the sentence
// "no new row id exists" above is true OF THE GREEN-TIME REPAIR PASS it describes,
// and it is NOT true of this file any more — the `CO` block at the END of this file
// adds ONE row, `CO-1` (the property-key coercion of an enumerated member). No
// existing id, register id, strategy id, attempt term, seed, pool, the `248` total
// or any diff-scope/type row moves; `CO-1` is a CLAUSE row, not a register row, so
// the register's eight declared rows and their terms are untouched by it.

// CO — THE PROPERTY-KEY COERCION OF A MEMBER INSIDE THE ENUMERATION.
//
// **This is a NEW row (`CO-1`), added by the red half of a later cycle, and it
// renumbers NOTHING**: no existing id, no register id, no strategy id, no attempt
// term, no seed, no pool, no `248` total and no diff-scope/type row moves. It is a
// CLAUSE row (not a register row), so the register's declared eight rows and their
// `248` attempts are untouched by it.
//
// THE MECHANISM, stated so the expectation is derived from the CONTRACT and never
// from the module's current behaviour. For a record write `out[key] = rhs()`, JS
// evaluates `ToPropertyKey(key)` BEFORE the right-hand side, and a throw there
// aborts the write. Where the `key` expression is the raw ENUMERATED MEMBER (this
// mechanism carries the member verbatim — `§0A` note 3, `§2.3` item 1 (v): no
// member is normalized, stringified, trimmed or validated), a member whose OWN
// primitive coercion THROWS (an own `Symbol.toPrimitive`/`valueOf`/`toString` that
// throws) therefore aborts the write BEFORE anything is computed for it.
//
// THE TWO HALVES THE CONTRACT PINS FOR THAT MEMBER — and only these two, because
// the clause pair below is the whole of what this contract says about it:
//
//   (1) `§2.3` ITEM 6 — THE CALL COUNTS. *"`isEmpty` is called exactly once per
//       ENUMERATED zone that passes the reveal gate; `trackFor` is called exactly
//       once per ENUMERATED zone that passes the reveal gate … and no delegate or
//       caller function is called for a zone outside those sets."* The member's own
//       coercion is NOT one of the two named exemptions: the only zero-call zone is
//       a zone that does NOT pass the gate, and `§2.3` item 1 (iv)'s `Symbol` member
//       is dropped BEFORE the loop body (it is not in "the sets" at all, and it is
//       skipped without a decision). A member that PASSES the reveal gate is inside
//       the set, so this clause admits no zero-call member.
//   (2) `§2.4 C-A` / `§3.3 I-2` — THE KEY-SET INVARIANT FOR THE MEMBERS THAT CAN
//       BE KEYS. *"the returned record's own enumerable string-key set equals
//       `{ String(m) : m ∈ E }` MINUS the `Symbol` members — no key outside that set
//       ever appears, and no member inside it is ever omitted"*, and the architect
//       ruling of 2026-09-27 makes `I-2` *"exact equality …, never an omission"*
//       (`§0A` ruling note 11). So `'b'` and `'c'` — ordinary string members that
//       DO have a legal property-key image — may never be lost because some OTHER
//       member was uncoercible.
//
// ⟶ CORRECTED 2026-09-27 (the SUPERVISOR'S RULING, landed as the `§2.4 C-A` (f)
// AMENDMENT — the header above is the PRE-RULING clause-gap framing and is
// SUPERSEDED on the uncoercible member's own class). This block previously reported
// a clause gap (*"the contract PINS neither the outcome nor the cost of the
// uncoercible member ITSELF"*). **The contract now PINS BOTH, and the ruling landed
// in `docs/specs/census.md` `§2.4 C-A` (f) — AMENDED 2026-09-27 (the `U-CENSUS`
// adversarial pass, findings `ADV-CN-1`/`ADV-CN-9`, and the module fix that
// followed)**. The class is GENERALIZED from *"the `Symbol` member"* to *"a member
// whose own PROPERTY-KEY COERCION cannot produce an own key"* — a `Symbol`, or an
// object whose own `Symbol.toPrimitive`/`valueOf`/`toString` throws under
// `ToPropertyKey` — and its FULL RULE is both halves: **(i) THE COST IS PAID** — such
// a member, if it passes the reveal gate, still costs **exactly one `isEmpty` and one
// `trackFor`** call in clause order, because `§2.3` item 6's zero-call exemption is
// for a member OUTSIDE the gate-passing set, never for an uncoercible one; **(ii) THE
// KEY IS NOT WRITTEN** — it contributes **no key** (the drop class, expressed as the
// ABSENCE of a key: **no reason, no sentinel, no skip vocabulary** — `§3.3 I-9`,
// `§0A` note 8) and **it must NOT end the enumeration**, so every member AFTER it that
// CAN be a key is still enumerated and still keyed (`I-2`'s no-omission half, which is
// UNCONDITIONAL and admits only this class); **(iii) the `Symbol` member KEEPS its
// zero-cost PRE-GATE drop** (`§2.3` item 1 (iv)) — **the two classes differ in COST,
// not in OUTCOME**. The spec's own falsifiers: *"a row asserting a key for such a
// member, or asserting that members after it are lost, FAILS; a row asserting zero
// delegate calls for a NON-`Symbol` uncoercible member FAILS."* **`'b'`/`'c'` keep
// their unconditional keys.**
//
// ⟶ THE DISCRIMINATOR, made REAL by this same correction (one cell was not brought
// along with the ruling). `trackFor`'s FIRST argument is the SPEC, and this drive's
// `specOf` (`(id) => SPEC_X`) returned **the same `SPEC_X` object for every member** —
// so `trackFor.filter((call) => Object.is(call[0], SPEC_X))` counted **the whole
// drive's** calls (4), not one member's, and could never be 1 while the row's own
// contract-required assertion `DELEGATE_LOG.trackFor.length === 4` held. The
// unsatisfiable cell asserted the row's INTENT — *the uncoercible member REACHED
// `trackFor`* — with the wrong instrument. **The instrument is now per-member:
// `specOf` returns a DISTINCT spec object per member and the count of `1` is taken
// against THAT member's OWN spec object BY IDENTITY.** The `isEmpty` half already
// discriminated by identity (`call[1] === thrower`); no member of this drive is left
// without a `trackFor` call of its own.
//
// THE FOUR EXISTING ASSERTION GROUPS ARE KEPT EXACTLY AS STRONG: cost `4/4` for both
// delegates (with the uncoercible member inside the 4), the emptiness lookups VERBATIM
// for all four members, no omission of `'b'`/`'c'`, and the key-set equality + count +
// order with NO key for the uncoercible member.
//
// THE MODULE IS NOT TOUCHED BY THIS PASS: the row is driven against the LANDED module
// (`src/shared/census.ts` is byte-for-byte the implementer's) and the red half is
// RUN and reported.

// CO-2 — THE `ADV-CN-2` REGRESSION ROW (the adversarial pass's finding, and the
// MODULE FIX that followed it). **A NEW row id in the `CO` clause family; it
// renumbers NOTHING** — no existing id, no register id, no strategy id, no attempt
// term, no seed, no pool, the `248` total or any diff-scope/type row moves, and it
// is a CLAUSE row, not a register row, so the register's eight declared rows and
// their terms are untouched by it.
//
// THE FINDING (`ADV-CN-2`) AND THE FIX. `sizes`/`specOf` are LOOKUPS with exactly
// TWO usable forms (`§2.3` items 4/5, `§0A` ruling note 5): **a CALLABLE** (called
// once per gate-passing member) **or an own-keyed RECORD** (read by own property).
// **Every other form is shape (c) of `§0A` note 5: "a number, a string, an array, a
// `null` … every lookup yields `undefined`".** An ARRAY is the sharp case, because
// it is an OBJECT whose own key `'0'` really does exist: an own-property read that
// did not first rule out the array class would hand `trackFor` the CALLER'S OWN
// VALUE — `sizes = [40]` would resolve as the size `40` and emit `'40px'` — which
// is precisely the outcome the note forbids. **The landed module now treats an
// ARRAY, a `Set` and a `Map` as NON-RECORDS and degrades every lookup on them to
// `undefined`** (`src/shared/census.ts`'s `lookupValue`: `if (Array.isArray(lookup)
// || lookup instanceof Map || lookup instanceof Set) return undefined`).
//
// ⟶ A NOTE ON WHAT THIS ROW CAN AND CANNOT DERIVE, stated before it is used.
// **(1) THE ARRAY IS PINNED VERBATIM** (`§0A` note 5's own enumeration: *"a number,
// a string, an array, a `null`"*) and so is the resulting limb: `undefined` handed to
// `trackFor` ⇒ the caller's `emptyToken` for a size (`§2.3` item 4, U-ZONES `§2.3`
// item 1 (b)) and `''` for a spec (`§2.3` item 5, the malformed-spec limb, evaluated
// FIRST there and gating the other limbs). **(2) THE `Map` IS ALSO PINNED, by the
// census's own non-record clause** — `§2.3` item 2's *"does not test `Map`/`Set`"*
// and `F-6`'s *"a non-record census … is `U-ZONES`'s `false`"* establish that this
// contract's RECORD class excludes a `Map` and a `Set`; the same two-form rule of
// `§2.3` items 4/5 then puts `Map`/`Set` in shape (c). **(3) THE `Set` IS THE ONE
// CASE THE SPEC DOES NOT ENUMERATE:** `§0A` note 5's sentence names *"a number, a
// string, an array, a `null`"* and does NOT name a `Set` (or a `Map`) in that list.
// **It is therefore REPORTED as derived, not quoted**: the `Set` cells below follow
// the GENERAL rule the note states (*"A non-callable, non-record `sizes`/`specOf`
// … is shape (c) of this note: every lookup yields `undefined`"*) plus the
// record-class reading of `§2.3` item 2. **The pair (spec section, what is missing)
// is reported to the supervisor**; the `Set` cells are driven because the contract's
// own two-form rule has no third form and the landed guard is one expression for all
// three containers — a row that drove only the array would leave the `Set`/`Map`
// branches of that single expression un-driven.
//
// ⟶ THE NON-VACUITY CONTROL IS PART OF THE ROW, not a separate nicety: **the same
// drive with a PLAIN RECORD and with a NULL-PROTOTYPE RECORD must STILL RESOLVE
// (`'40px'`).** A guard that swallowed records too would make the `undefined` cells
// above green for the wrong reason, so this row FAILS on such a module — the
// degradation must be confined to the non-record class (`§2.3` items 4/5).
//
// THE MODULE IS NOT TOUCHED BY THIS PASS. The row was authored against the LANDED
// module (green below), and the drive is literal and minimal: `zones = ['0']`, an
// EMPTY census (so the delegate's emptiness answer is a plain `false` — the value
// cells then read the SIZE/SPEC limbs alone), and one caller spec carrying a
// distinctive `emptyToken` so the caller's limb is nameable.
