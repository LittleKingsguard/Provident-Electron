 *  WIRING ROLE: THE ATTRIBUTE-NAME HOLDER.** The appearance control's attribute name is the CALLER's
 *  own string, so it lands HERE — nowhere in the envelope and in no mechanism (`§2.1` item 4) — and
 *  this role carries it: `attributeName` is a CALLER-SUPPLIED constant, echoed BY IDENTITY under the
 *  sibling mechanism's own rule (`§0` ruling 14: a non-empty string is the name; the empty string,
 *  every non-string and the omitted argument are the declared `null`; no coercion hook and no
 *  normalisation is ever consulted — which is why nothing here trims, lower-cases or parses it).
 *  **IT IS DELIBERATELY INERT, AND THAT IS THE CONTRACT:** it holds a VALUE, it WRITES NOTHING (no
 *  attribute, no class, no style, no markup, no created element — `§2.4` item 2), it dispatches no
 *  event, it holds no state, and NOTHING in this unit reads it (`§2.4` items 1/4: the control's ONE
 *  write is a `content` mutation on a graph node, performed by the authored envelope handler).
 *  `stateNodeId` is the AUTHORED state node the caller reads back through the existing tools
 *  (`provident.get_node_state`), so the role names the graph-side carrier and resolves its element
 *  from the PRODUCING GRAPH — never a selector, a lookup or a created element.
 *  **THE ID IS THE ENVELOPE'S OWN, NEVER RE-SPELLED HERE** (`§2.4` item 2, `§2.1` item 1(5), the
 *  ADV-TC-3 collision): the role DERIVES it from the authored envelope at the call, as the ONE
 *  authored node carrying `props.id` AND `css.id` with the same value while its `content` is one of
 *  the two declared block members — the state node `theme-setting` in today's envelope — and hands
 *  THAT id to the runtime's node-id read. A rename in the envelope therefore moves the id this role
 *  resolves, instead of leaving a second, silently staling spelling behind (`§3.4` R-4). */
