// U-LISTHOST · the owned-node list host (docs/specs/listhost.md §2.1).
//
// A container manager for CALLER-CREATED nodes. The caller supplies the
// entries, the nodes, the ordering policy and the callbacks; this host places
// those nodes inside the injected mount in the projected order and removes
// ONLY the nodes it placed, leaving every other child of the mount untouched.
//
// It authors no content — no text, no label, no class, no style, no attribute.
// It reads no tree to compute its order: the order is this host's own
// projection over its own bookkeeping. It imports nothing, keeps no
// module-level state, persists nothing, and exposes exactly the seven names
// below.
